Building a todo list rather than doing any actual work.

Very rough Kanban board for ProcessWire. The idea is to keep todo lists in the PW admin rather than explain to users how to use Github Projects or Trello.

It's an early stage at the moment but kind of works ... kind of... expect things to break though. Hopefully I'll be able to polish it up with all the time I'll save by being more productive.
